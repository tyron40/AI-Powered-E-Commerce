## Overview

This project is a modern e-commerce platform enhanced with artificial intelligence to provide personalized shopping experiences. The AI recommendation engine analyzes user preferences, browsing history, and purchase patterns to suggest products tailored to each user.

## Features

### AI-Powered Recommendations

- **Personalized Product Suggestions**: Recommendations based on user preferences and purchase history
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests similar products based on features and descriptions
- **Trending Products**: Identifies popular items across the platform
- **Category-Based Recommendations**: Suggests products from preferred categories

### Shopping Experience

- **Product Browsing**: Browse products with filtering by category and price
- **Product Search**: Search functionality with real-time results
- **Product Details**: Comprehensive product information with similar product suggestions
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and update quantities of products

### User Interface

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for all device sizes
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with smooth transitions
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for improved user experience

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js for recommendation engine
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API requests
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## AI Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine uses a multi-strategy approach:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: TensorFlow.js model trained on user-product interactions
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Similarity calculations based on product attributes
3. **Popularity-Based Recommendations**: Trending products based on ratings and views
4. **Ensemble Approach**: Combines multiple strategies for better recommendations

### How It Works

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts meaningful features from products
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Computes similarity between products
3. **Model Training**: Trains a neural network on product features
4. **Personalization**: Adjusts recommendations based on user preferences
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provides reasonable recommendations even when data is limited
